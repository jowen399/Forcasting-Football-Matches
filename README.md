# Forcasting-Football-Matches
An investigation into a predictive data model to forecast football match outcomes. 

#### Description:

This project was completed during my studies for my 'Postgraduate certificate in Applied Data Science' course. It investigates whether it is possible to apply statistical analysis and data modelling methods to predict the outcome of a football (soccer) match. 

#### Contents:

* A detailed written report discussing the theory underpinning the project, and discusses the investigation and development of the solution. 
* The executable ipynb file, which processes the raw data and simulates results
* The raw data (in the form of CSVs)

#### Installation: 

* Before installing, I recommend reading the written report, to understand the theory and decisions made
* To run the file inpynb, the raw data (CSVs) will need to be saved locally or uploaded into google colab. The existing file names must be retained.
* When using the Anaconda distribution package, no pip installs are required, however, this may be required if using a different platform to run the code.
